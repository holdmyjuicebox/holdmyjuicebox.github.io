<p>
   There isnt much that is interesting really. 
   I enjoy playing sports but I excel the most at tennis and football.
   However, for football I mainly watch Liverpool FC games because I am a big fan of them and for tenis well I can watch nearly all the matches.
   I went to a small school named Arrows Resource Center, it's located in Ara Damansara.
   Which I recently graduated from at the end of 2017.
   I come from a family of four with myslef being the youngest at 17 and I have a elder sister who's 23 this year.

   As stated before I enjoy playing Football and tennis. 
   I used to be from the Harimau junior but that was a very long time ago.
   As for tennis, I recently joined a few tournaments but didn't get very far becuase its tough playing adults who are physcially stronger than I am.
   I've won one tournament in Port Dickson before
   Also, I thoroughly enjoy listening to music.
   It would be hard to class one genre for me.
   It spans from hip-hop,indie-alternative,rock and many more.

         I enjoy watching movies such as Marvel's movies. 
         My favourite superhero since young is Spider-Man. 
         Since the MCU has started Iron Man is up there too. 
         After watching Marvel's Infinity War it has left me wanting more for sure and made cant wait for Avengers 4 next year to see how it unfolds.

         Although I don't play video games as often. 
         I recently bought God of War and it reminded me why loved video games to start with. 
         It's not only exillerating but it tells a beautiful story about the father-son relationsip. 
         I could go on and on about how good the game mechanics are or how invested the game made me but I wouldn't have enough time to say everything!
